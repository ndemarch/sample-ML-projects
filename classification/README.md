A significant number of hotel bookings are called off due to cancellations or no-shows. Typical reasons for cancellations include 
change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost. 
This may be beneficial to hotel guests, but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. Such 
losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations.


Four machine learning models are tested (logistic regression, SVM, decision tree and random forest) to provide four useful business recommendations 
to prevent cancellations.
