Sample problem in computer vision.


Kaggle competition dataset. The winner of this project obtained an accuracy on the validation data of ~ 90%, here I manage 
an accuracy closer to 92% with custom neural network and ~99% using transfer learning.


- The script catdog_network.py contains the 3 neural network models considered for the project. 
- The jupyter notebook CNN_notebook.ipynb contains our interactive example.
